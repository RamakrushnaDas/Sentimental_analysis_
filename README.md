# Sentimental_analysis_
Sentiment analysis is categorised as positive, neutral, or negative based on a model trained on more than 40,000 Twitter comments. The model catches emotional nuances well by utilising Word2Vec to turn tweet text into numerical vectors and powerful NLP algorithms. It helps measure brand sentiment, provides deeper insights into public opinion, and detects developing patterns in real time with the extra precision of hyperparameter tuning.
