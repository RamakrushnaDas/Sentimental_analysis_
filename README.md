The sentiment analysis model, trained on 150,000+ Twitter comments, categorizes them as positive, neutral, or negative. By analyzing tweet text using NLP techniques and converting it into numerical vectors like Word2Vec, the model captures emotional undertones. This helps track brand sentiment, identify trends, and provide public opinion insights.
